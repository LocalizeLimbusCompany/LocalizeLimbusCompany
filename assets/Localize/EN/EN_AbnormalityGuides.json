I did not see sound-producing organs like the mouth or a vocal cord in motion.\n\"Bring the Snow White,\" spoke the Abnormality. A report on the former L Corp. I analyzed after disengaging suggests that it has a connection with F-04-42.\nIn addition, I discovered a corpse that seemed to belong to the staff that arrived here before us for preliminary investigation. Their ID confirmed that they were from the Operations Planning department, so we retrieved the remains and left the scene before a battle could break out.\nConcluding the report."

      "content": "The unfortunate traits of being Backstreets-born are apparent in this Sinner. She loves money, gambling, and betting—so it is advised to pay close attention to her as the manager. She tends to deflect orders with an unimpressive wink or a silly joke; we recommend taking a stern stance at times to remind her that you are her superior. Her mood may be down at irregular intervals. There is nothing you can do to aid her in that state, so we recommend waiting for it to pass."

His thoughts and feelings are blatantly visible in his demeanor, and he has no intention of hiding them; his brashness may cause headaches (or physical injury leading to a headache) in the process of forming a relationship. Please do note that this is not an indication of serious damage to the Sinner's thought process. If his fit of rage persists, please contact the human resources department. Once you realize that he is the type that tends to be simple-minded, you'll have an easier time handling him."

She claims that there is no one in the City who could rival her library of knowledge and wisdom, and she isn't necessarily wrong. You might find her high and mighty attitude when she allows you to converse with her displeasing, but as seen with how she treats everyone with subtle gestures of arrogance, there is no hope of her parting with it, ever. We recommend simply nodding once and getting over it. Even though she has an unparalleled genius, we can't quite figure out how to use this one. Perhaps you could be the one to find out?"

However, she also has a meddlesome tendency, so it is recommended to keep her satisfied with short replies of agreement. She is an expert when it comes to tactics and various pearls of wisdom about life, making her advice all the more valuable for your mission. In addition, she possesses a vast knowledge of workshop technologies; you could trust her with simple repairs of the bus. \nNOTICE: Unlike the other Sinners, accessing records pertaining to the past of this Sinner is not permitted.\nWARNING: Keep an eye on this Sinner and beware that she does not exercise her cunning intellect for purposes other than completing our company's mission."

As such, he has a certain admiration for a free life; but occasionally, he may make ignorant and unsavory questions in regards to the food cooked by a certain other Sinner or other aspects of the low-lives' lowly culture. This can cause significant irritation for the other sinners. However, it is important to note that no sarcastic undertones are contained in his curiosity-driven inquiries, so it is ill-advised to let them get physical over it."

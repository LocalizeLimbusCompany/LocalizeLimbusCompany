These Wings contribute to the quality of life in the City via astounding technological feats known as ‘Singularities’. Under the jurisdiction of a Wing, the citizens of each Nest enjoy comfortable and safe lives. However, that changes the moment a Wing is snapped or plucked of its feathers; historically, the fall of a Wing has accompanied events of considerable magnitudes.\nIn time, a new Wing will rise to fill that vacant spot. In the meantime, though… no one can guarantee your safety in its fallen Nest."

The corporation has fallen since the ‘White Nights and Dark Days’ incident, and the spot of Nest L’s Wing remains unclaimed to this day.\nBecause the former L Corp’s electric grids had encompassed the City, its branches were built in various places. Though these branch facilities have all fallen to ruin with the collapse of the Wing, you should still be able to find valuable goods.\nAlong with… possibly the most dangerous beings you’ll face."

You can expect them to still prowl the ruins of these sealed facilities."

To rise through the ranks and earn higher Grades, they must prove themselves through trackable performance. (Of course, some are uninterested in career advancement altogether.)\nWhile Fixers exist to solve the City’s problems, it’s no secret that these Fixers can be sources of problems themselves."

Cases occurring in the City are handed over to the Associations according to their specialties, and they then distribute those cases to the Fixers that are deemed to be best suited for the job.\nAn Office is similar to an Association in that it’s an organized group of Fixers, but it’s usually far smaller in scale. Some Offices are directly affiliated with an Association that issues tasks to them, while others seek clients and requests on their own. As some aptly put it: “There are as many Offices as there are Fixers.” A great number of Offices exist in the City, seeing constant waves of new entries as well as those sucked up by metaphorical riptides."

However, an upsurge of emotion or a sudden change of environment may cause parts or the whole of his body to transform into insectile (notably akin to a carapace, resembling that of the _________) tissues. If you do not wish to be a rude manager (not that you're obligated to be nice), we recommend keeping your facial expression in check so that your disgust is not visible to him. He sometimes uses cynical language, but he can still be reasoned with, and you can get around him without much difficulty as long as you learn the knack of it."

She claims that there is no one in the City who could rival her library of knowledge and wisdom, and she isn't necessarily wrong. You might find her high and mighty attitude when she allows you to converse with her displeasing, but as seen with how she treats everyone with subtle gestures of arrogance, there is no hope of her parting with it, ever. We recommend simply nodding once and getting over it. Even though she has an unparalleled genius, we can't quite figure out how to use this one. Perhaps you could be the one to find out?"

However, you mustn't forget: this Sinner has survived an absurd voyage in a far and wide body of water. Her patience may run deep, but once you take a wrong turn with her, it will be a difficult task to regain her trust."

He isn't used to real combat at the moment, meaning that he may struggle to keep himself together at the sight of something as mild as spilt innards at first. As there may be those with violent tendencies among your crew, we recommend taking an approach focused on positive reinforcement with this sinner. He appears to possess a murderous gaze that he himself isn't aware of; this is a hopeful sign that he has the potential to grow into an expert of our company's profession with the right stimuli."

If the Sinner remains silent for a long time, that means he is currently processing a line of deliberate thought; we recommend waiting patiently for him."

In addition, she possesses a vast knowledge of workshop technologies; you could trust her with simple repairs of the bus. \nNOTICE: Unlike the other Sinners, accessing records pertaining to the past of this Sinner is not permitted.\nWARNING: Keep an eye on this Sinner and beware that she does not exercise her cunning intellect for purposes other than completing our company's mission."

This can cause significant irritation for the other sinners. However, it is important to note that no sarcastic undertones are contained in his curiosity-driven inquiries, so it is ill-advised to let them get physical over it."

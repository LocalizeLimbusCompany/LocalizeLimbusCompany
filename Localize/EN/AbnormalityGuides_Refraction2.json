I raise its broad wrinkles and wide pillar as supporting evidence.\nWhat was odd, however, was that its height was far too stocky despite its aforementioned traits.\nIts twisting branches all point to a singular direction, and clues indicate that its roots are broad and deep-reaching…\nAfter a thorough observation of the blue fairy(I’m unsure if this is an appropriate designation for it, but I was unable to find another suitable name), which hangs from the tip of one of the branches and radiates a bright light,\nI concluded that this is a trap contingent on deception.\nSuch deceptive traps were often used in numerous battles I have participated in. Install something to draw the attention of your enemies and ambush them from where they least expect… It’s a rather rudimentary trap.\nI have ordered the Sinners to halt their advance and await the Executive Manager’s orders.\nPlease consult this guide in your future commands.\nThank you.\n→ Wow… I guess you’re not a veteran for nothing, huh?

Now we know why its height betrays its apparent age.\nThe majority of its bulk, its main body, is buried underground.\nCountless roots, long enough to make measurement of their individual lengths difficult, burst out of the ground to impale us. Still, we were able to identify that this opponent’s main mode of attack involves luring its victims toward its main body to guarantee a strike.\nSometimes it focused on a single Sinner, but there were also instances in which it targeted multiple of us at once.\nI also identified the blue fairy swaying from side to side, as though to seduce its victims.\nThough it may be difficult to engage this opponent while evading its numerous roots, because we are currently unaware of the magnitude of its main body, I believe that continued collection of intel through repeated encounters is necessary to prepare the appropriate countermeasures. Some losses are to be expected, however.\nConcluding the report.\nThank you.\n→ Seriously, Heathcliff! Why the hell would you walk out there AFTER we specifically told you not to?

Whoever made that thing should feel lucky they don’t work for my family.\nWell… I guess every gardener has different standards of beauty. But from what I can see, I don’t really get what kind of beauty they were going for?\nLike, the… the thing? Object? They hung in the middle of the wooden planks. I think it has eyes, or something.\nMaybe they were trying to say something with this work. Like ‘Surveillance and Bondage’, or something?\nAnyway, I don’t really enjoy artworks that are this hideous~\n→ It’s all sunshine and rainbows with you, innit? Gardener? Piece of art? What is wrong with you? It’s a monster that skewers people!\n→ Disagreed. T.I.A. (Someone scribbled ”I think she’s saying ‘This Is Art’!” here.) From grotesqueries rises artistic merit. I’m surprised that you caught on."

I guess that’s what’s so special about this ugly thing.\nAs soon as we encounetered them, they tied us down here, like they were trying to stop us from going any further."

          "story": "I had no idea… that getting wrapped up in those rose brambles could hurt that much.\nBack home, I saw some people get roped up and made to kneel for their wrongdoings… I never realized how merciful my family was. We used plain ropes for that.\nAnd those thorns… it was like they were draining my blood. Like it was hungry for nutrients.\nAnd there’s more. You know how we sometimes… die, during these fights? \nBodies weren’t the only things falling—people’s resolve did, too. Oh, it’s not like being stressed or psychologically pressured. It’s completely different. It was like some… emotion in me was getting snapped in half.\nAnd the way they died was also unusual. Its vines crawled up their legs, binding them… Soon blooming with Roses.\nOh, and... the color of those roses changed as well. Everyone told me that it was as though the bottled—up feelings inside them were melting away. And so did I.\nAnd when we killed it… Everyone who fell in the battle exploded along with it.\nLeaving behind nothing but… petals."

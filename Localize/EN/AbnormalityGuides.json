Instead, it initiated direct communication through the psyche.\nOut of all the languages I knew, the Abnormality appeared to use my most commonly spoken one. I did not see any sound-producing organs such as the mouth or vocal cords in motion.\n“Bring Snow White.” This is what the Abnormality said. A report on the former L Corp. I analyzed after disengagement suggests that it has a connection with F-04-42.\nIn addition, I discovered a corpse that seemed to belong to the staff that arrived here before us for preliminary investigation. Their ID confirmed that they were from the Operations Planning department, so we retrieved the remains and left the scene before a battle could break out.\nConcluding the report."

It wraps its vines around itself as well, forming a shape that resembles a dress; it is possible that it believes itself to be a “noble”.\nIts vines are used in a variety of ways, such as persistently stabbing one Sinner and rising from the floor to injure multiple Sinners.\nIn addition, its sturdy exterior made it difficult to damage.\nIn one battle where many Sinners were lost, we managed to remove one of its arms.

Although Heathcliff’s head was destroyed as well, it should be a negligible loss as it is a renewable asset.\nIt continued to move and attack despite the lack of a head, but we found that its exterior significantly softened.\nRemoving its “limbs” became a much more manageable task.\nEven though the head grew back after a period of time, the removal of its arms and legs in the meantime freed us from the threat of powerful attacks for the rest of the operation.\nConcluding the report."

I did not see any sound-producing organs such as the mouth or vocal cords in motion.\n“Bring Snow White.” This is what the Abnormality said. A report on the former L Corp. I analyzed after disengagement suggests that it has a connection with F-04-42.\nIn addition, I discovered a corpse that seemed to belong to the staff that arrived here before us for preliminary investigation.

Whenever a Sinner was attacked by it, causalgia and burns could be observed.\n- Clouds of gas assumed to be breaths or steam were observed near its head.\n- It sometimes raised its body to slam a Sinner with its weight. And other times, from the head...the humanlike being emerged for an attack. Its dizzying cry left a lasting impression.\n- When a Sinner was attacked by the humanlike being, they would display serious depression.

It felt muddy and damp. It was like being splashed with the sea water from a breaking wave.\n\nIt didn't feel too strong. Well, I'll figure out more as we fight."

        "[{0}] reaches out toward the flames, enduring through the burning fire.\n\nBut the pain of their very skin blistering and bubbling from the heat was far too much for them to bear. [{0}] pulled away from the flames before they reached the shadow.\n\nThe price of letting this opportunity fall through their fingers was devastating.\n\nThe moth begins to beat its wings faster and with unforeseen vigor; and the flames began rising higher and higher in return.\n\nIt need not be said that a world of fire soon descended upon the Sinners."

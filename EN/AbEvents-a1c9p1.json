It won’t be as hard as the first time.\n\nThe Sinners seem to agree.\n\nThe fairy simply sat there in near complete stillness, only interrupted by its intermittently vibrating wings. It was as though the fairy knew you were coming.",

Perhaps it was just the swaying of branches.\n\n”The eyes are coming out…”\n\n”Get outta there! Here we go again.”\n\nNumerous eyes open one by one, gleaming from the shadows.\n\nThey oscillate as though they’ll jump out at us at any minute.\n\nSo… What now?"

Assuming that a bait would remain stationary is a complacent thought.\n\nThe fairy had also lightly flown up into the air and glared at the Sinner, who dared to attack it.\n\n”G-get out of there! It’s starting to move again!”\n\n[{0}] tried to get away, but its main body had already tightened around the Sinner's legs.\n\nSo… What now?"

Tickets are, in a way, mediums that unlock destinations for us, a means by which we may travel to places. They also serve as transactional items—a permit to board, to enter. A currency that acts as both the price and right of access. But that is true only in a physical sense. A \"ticket\" need not be a slip of paper.\nSome considered that last spider's thread—the last lifeline of hope that could pull their downtrodden selves out of an inescapable pit—as a \"ticket.\" Something that lifts me up or invites me somewhere may be called a ticket as well; it is likely that these artifacts assume the form of tickets for that precise reason. Perhaps this elaboration has been too verbose. - A Team Leader at LCD"

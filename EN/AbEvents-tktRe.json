This thing's way too small!\"\n\nIt's barely large enough to cover someone's torso.\n\n\"W-well, 'tis better than having naught to break their fall!\"\n\nEither way, there wasn't enough time for us to go out and look for an alternative. The Sinners decided to stand around in a circle to use their bodies to break their fall.\n\n... Who, eventually, did.\n\nThe shock absorption was distributed amongst several bodies, and the tiny cushion at least managed to protect the person's back, but...\n\n... once it was over, most of the Sinners were stumbling around with either broken arms or cracked spines."

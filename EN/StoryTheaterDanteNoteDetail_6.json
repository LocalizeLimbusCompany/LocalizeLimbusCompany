(Heathcliff told me that when he finally got to write the observation log after putting it off for a long while, he noticed that it was already marked with a Risk Level.) Since these logs are probably connected directly to the Limbus Company headquarters, maybe they’re checking these pretty frequently?"

            "desc": "- It seems pretty obvious, but the Risk Levels are rated based on the potential amount of damage that each Abnormality can cause, and the difficulty of facing it in combat. I see… I suppose that’s why they told the Sinners to focus on the details of the combat encounter and each Abnormality’s identifying characteristics when writing the logs.\n- Hm, but I also remember that some of the lower-risk level Abnormalities were harder and more complicated to fight than the higher-risk Abnormalities.\n- Maybe it’s the Golden Bough suppressing the Abnormalities’ strength (I’m gonna guess that’s what ‘Qliphoth Deterrence’ means)… but it’s probably just that there are some errors in the Risk Levels.\n- So I asked Faust about those possible errors, and she proceeded to clear up a few questions I had about the difference between the Abnormalities’ Risk Levels and the actual difficulty we felt when facing them.\n- The standards to rating each Abnormality's Risk Levels followed Lobotomy Corporation's definition of each Risk Levels, which then the LCA used to rate them. Turns out the data from Lobotomy Corporation didn't exactly match our on-field experience against the Abnormalities.\n- LCA is aware of this disparity. Sounds like they're going to announce some new standards to categorize them by.\n- I was told that they were going to use our combat data and the samples collected by Limbus Company to re-organize and re-categorize the Risk Levels."

From what I've seen of the City, I'm pretty sure that there are literally countless people out there who are pushed to their emotional extremes.

Just like how Abnormalities and Distortions are oddly similar yet different from each other, the Peccatula appear to be oddly similar yet different from Distortions.\n- Sinclair heard me and mused that if they feel similar yet different... then maybe they both come from the same source, and what failed to become a Distortion becomes one of the Peccatula.\n- Yeah, that makes sense to me. Those that fail to become Distortions become Peccatula... that seems to be the most likely guess unless anything new crops up.\n\n- Risk Level assessments and serial numbers for each Peccatulum are also getting reworked. Probably thanks to those new Peccatula we saw at Yong-jin building.\n- Faust added that our encounter with the new entities and the need for the company to categorize Abnormalities, Distortions, and Peccatula separately was what brought on the overhaul of the company's categorization system. Yeah, that's pretty much what I was thinking."
